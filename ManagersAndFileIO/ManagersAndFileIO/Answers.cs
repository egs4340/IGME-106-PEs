        // Answer any questions that are listed in the PE with a question mark:

        // Why is Monster abstract?
        // Briefly summarize:  What code does the Monster class have/is handling?  
        // Briefly summarize:  What code do the two child classes have/are handling?  
        // Why are those classes handling the code that they contain?  (In other words, why was the project architecture designed this way?)
        // Why is the Random object a field of the Monster class and not a field of the child classes?
    }
